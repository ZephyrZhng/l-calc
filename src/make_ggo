#If you modify L_cmd.ggo you should:
/usr/local/bin/gengetopt < Lcommandline.ggo
#to produce cmdline.c and .h
#and then move the cmdline.h file to the ../include/ directory:
mv -f cmdline.h ../include/

#or simply just run this script by typing ./make_ggo

#To download and install gengetopt:
#http://www.gnu.org/software/gengetopt/

#Do not use fink's installed version. It doesn't seem to work.
#Rather do a ./configure, make, make install of
#GNU Gengetopt 2.14 (or more recent version).
