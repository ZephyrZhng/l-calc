Version 1.3
-----------

Implemented explicit formula checking before outputting zeros. See the README.txt
file for an explanation. This makes it much less likely for errors in the zeros.

Fixed a subtle bug whereby one zero was counted with multiplicity, and a
corresponding number of subsequent zeros were then overlooked (lcalc finds
zeros by looking for sign changes of the Hardy Z function and using Turing's
test to make sure that no zeros are missed. If missed zeros are detected, the
program back tracks to look for them. Sometimes this resulted in the
same zero being mistaken as two distinct zeros, if, for example, they differed
in the last decimal place).

Added the option to start at the N-th to find_zeros routine (-N in the command line).

Improved routines for derivatives.

Improved output precision.

Implemented lcalc's own trig and complex exponential functions (basically, cosine 
which runs about 4 times faster than machine cosine).
